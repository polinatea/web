<h1>Robert Pattinson</h1>
<h2>Robert Pattinson. Bio</h2>

<p>Born on May 13, 1986, in London, England, actor Robert Pattinson first became known to audiences for his role of Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter 
and the Goblet of Fire. Soon after, his turn as vampire Edward Cullen in Twilight catapulted him to heartthrob status. Along with the Twilight sequels,
Pattinson's notable films include Remember Me, Water for Elephants, Cosmopolis and The Lost City of Z. In 2019, he was selected to play the Caped Crusader 
in the upcoming The Batman.</p>
<p><a class="other_text_dec">Robert Thomas Pattinson</a> was born on <a>May 13, 1986</a>, in <a>London, England</a>. 
<a class="other_text_dec">Pattinson</a> is the youngest of three children, and the only son born to Robert and Clare Pattinson. During his childhood,
 his father ran a car-importing business and his mother worked for a modeling agency.</p>

<p>Despite his sometimes shy personality, <a class="other_text_dec">Robert Pattinson</a> wanted to be a performer from an early age, first as a musician like his older sister Lizzy. 
It was his father who strongly encouraged him to try out acting. During one memorable night out for dinner with his dad, the two found themselves sitting 
next to a group of young girls who told Pattinson they'd just returned from the Barnes Theatre Club, a renowned program at the Harrodian School, outside 
of London.</p>

<p>Pattinson's performances drew <a style="color: green">notice</a> and in 2003, at the age of 17, he jumped from the stage to the screen, nabbing a role in the TV movie Ring of the
Nibelungs. The work required him to move to South Africa for several months, where the movie was being filmed. An unaccredited role in Vanity Fair (2004)
followed.</p>

<p>Around the same time that he <a style="font-size:2em">was</a> finishing up <a style="font-size:2rem">work</a> on those two projects, Pattinson met with Mike Newell, the eventual director of 2005's Harry Potter 
and the Goblet of Fire. The meeting and subsequent audition earned Pattinson the role of Cedric Diggory, Harry Potter's friend and a fellow wizard.</p>

<p>The movie and the role propelled Pattinson's life and career forward in unimaginable ways. Teen People magazine called him "the next Jude Law" while Screen
International magazine labeled him a "British Star of Tomorrow." It was heady stuff and, as Pattinson freely admits, it did indeed go to his head a bit.</p>

<p>A big Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson fan, Pattinson's post-Potter plan was to take on smaller roles in plays or films that could let him explore unique 
characters. He did go on to play a shell-shocked World War II veteran in the BBC thriller The Haunted Airman (2005); a student with a teacher crush in The
Bad Mother's Handbook (2006); and make a small cameo as Diggory in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007). But he was also fired from a play in 
London and, before Pattinson knew it, he was in Los Angeles sleeping on his agent's couch and trying to figure out his next step.</p>


<p>What followed was a shot at the film <a id="link_change" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(2008_film)">Twilight</a>. His audition for the role of Edward Cullen, a century-old vampire in love, took place in the bedroom of the 
movie's director, Catherine Hardwicke. Pattinson wowed both Hardwicke and his future co-star, Kristen Stewart, with his performance. "Everybody came in doing
something empty and shallow and thoughtless," Stewart told GQ. "But Rob understood that it wasn't a frivolous role."</p>

<p>And yet, for the legions of Twilight readers, who had waited breathlessly for the movie adaptation, Pattinson's casting as the perfectly gorgeous
 Cullen struck a nerve: There were calls for a boycott of the film and 75,000 fans signed a petition asking he be removed from the cast.</p>
